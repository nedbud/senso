       * One ladder, tuned for Bangla.
       *
       * Before this the site used forty-four different text sizes — nine of
       * them between 13px and 17.5px, and nine separate clamp() curves for
       * headings, so every heading grew at its own rate as the window moved.
       * That is what made the page feel unsettled rather than any single
       * value being wrong.
       *
       * Line heights run looser than a Latin site would: marks sit above the
       * matra and conjuncts hang below the baseline, so 1.375 that reads as
       * comfortable in English closes up in Bangla. The small end is
       * deliberately short — micro and xs are for things nobody has to read,
       * because the audience here is largely over 55.
