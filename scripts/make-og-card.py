"""
Builds public/og.png — the card WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook show when
someone shares the site.

    python3 scripts/make-og-card.py

Run it whenever a fact on the card changes. It is a script and not a design
file because every line on it is a fact that will go out of date: the year, the
number of patients, the phone number.

Two things it is easy to get wrong here, both learned the hard way:

  Punctuation. The Bengali cut of Anek has no Latin comma, so "২০,০০০" renders
  a hollow box in the middle of the number. Use "২০ হাজার", and the danda for
  sentence ends.

  The logo. public/assets/Icons/logo.png is Mistri Solutions Limited, left over
  from whoever built the original site. Senso's mark is the one used below, and
  it is sized by height — sized by width it runs off the bottom of the card and
  loses the "HEARING CENTRE DHAKA" line, which is the half that says what the
  business does.

Fonts come from the system (fonts-anek-bangla). The site loads the same family
over the web, so the card and the page it opens are set in one typeface.
