/**
 * Asking someone with hearing loss to phone you as the price of admission is
 * the wrong default for a hearing clinic, so this section leads with writing.
 *
 * There used to be a callback form under here — name, phone, best time to
 * call, and a box headed "what is happening with your hearing?". It posted
 * from the visitor's browser straight to EmailJS, a company in the United
 * States. That box is where someone types "ডান কানে শুনি না", which makes it
 * health data about an identified person, leaving the country, with nothing
 * said to them about it. Bangladesh has had a data protection law since the
 * 2025 Ordinance and the 2026 Act, and this was the clearest breach of it on
 * the site.
 *
 * It is gone rather than rerouted, because the thing it was for is now done
 * better anyway: Naati takes the same name and number, understands the
 * problem, and puts an actual serial in the clinic's book instead of adding
 * a row to somebody's inbox.
